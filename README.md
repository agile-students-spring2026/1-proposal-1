# Meowtivation

## What and Why

Meowtivation is a web-based self-management software system delivered via a browser extension, designed to help users build better self-discipline and personal planning habits in a more engaging and intuitive way. The system has its own app or web interface for configuration and feedback; the browser extension serves as the primary way to monitor users’ browsing activity in the background. The companion interface is delivered as a web application that can be used on both desktop and mobile browsers, aligning the project with a mobile web application scope.

Many existing productivity and habit-tracking tools rely heavily on manual input. Users are often expected to log their activities, estimate how long they worked, or remember to check in daily. Over time, this high recording cost leads to inaccurate data and, ultimately, abandonment of the tool.

Meowtivation addresses this problem by passively collecting reliable behavioral data through the extension. Instead of asking users to record their actions, the extension monitors how much time users spend on different web pages and categories. This data is then translated into a virtual pet growth system in the app or web interface, allowing users to visualize their habits and progress in a concrete and motivating way.

By lowering the barrier to self-tracking and turning abstract time usage into emotional feedback, Meowtivation aims to help users better understand their own behavior and gradually improve their self-discipline.

## For Whom

This software is intended for people who spend a significant amount of time working or studying on their computers, particularly younger users such as university students and early-career professionals.

These users often juggle multiple responsibilities, such as coursework, job searching, campus-related tasks, and leisure activities. While they may want to manage their time more effectively, they are often unwilling or unable to maintain detailed manual records of their daily activities. Meowtivation is designed specifically for users who want meaningful insights into their time usage without the burden of constant self-reporting.

## How

From the user’s perspective, Meowtivation is delivered via a browser extension as the main monitoring entry, together with an app or web interface for setup and feedback.

After installing the extension, users can open the app or web interface to create and customize a virtual pet, choosing from different animal types. Users may also categorize common websites or browser tabs into groups such as studying, job searching, campus activities, or entertainment.

As users browse the web, the extension runs in the background and automatically tracks the amount of time spent in each category. Based on this data, Meowtivation generates periodic summaries in the app or web interface that show how the user’s time is distributed. These summaries directly affect the virtual pet’s resources and growth, providing immediate and intuitive feedback on the user’s habits.

Through continuous passive monitoring via the extension and visual feedback in the interface, users can reflect on their behavior and make adjustments without changing their daily workflow. The system may later be extended to a mobile web interface.

## Scope

Meowtivation is designed to be an appropriate project for a team of approximately four to six programmers over the course of one semester.

The core scope of the project includes a browser extension for activity monitoring, a companion app or web interface, basic data aggregation, user-defined categorization, and a virtual pet feedback system. These features are sufficient to demonstrate the system’s value while remaining achievable within the given timeframe.

If time permits, the project may be extended with additional features such as a mobile web interface, more detailed analytics, enhanced pet interactions, or alternative feedback mechanisms. These extensions are optional and not required for the project’s core functionality.
